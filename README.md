# Gender-Plugin
Minecraft plugin allowing players to specify their gender

Also, optionally allows for "new" gender types if the server administrator so chooses.
This plugin is intended to be used primarily as a tool for other plugins, allowing replecement of genderless messages.

For example, instead of "PurplePheonix has reached their destination. They are now at 20 points"
With use of this plugin's API: "PurplePheonix has reached her destination. She is now at 20 points"

TIP: Here is a handy Java/C++ shortcut you can use:
"<a message>" + (gender == male ? "He" : "She") + "<rest of message>"
